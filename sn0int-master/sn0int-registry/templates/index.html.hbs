        This is the registry server of sn0int, a semi-automatic OSINT framework and
        package manager.  It was built for IT security professionals and bug hunters to
        gather intelligence about a given target or about yourself. sn0int is
        enumerating attack surface by semi-automatically processing public information
        and mapping the results in a unified format for followup investigations.
        </p>

        <p>
        The registry server allows uploading modules that can be installed by
        users afterwards. This is done using sn0int which needs to be <a
        href="https://sn0int.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">installed</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
        To install a module run:
        </p>
        <p class="code"><code>
        sn0int install kpcyrd/ctlogs
        </code></p>

        {{#each modules}}
            <h3>[ {{@key}} ]</h3>
            <ul class="modules">
            {{#each this}}
                <li>
                    <span class="mod-cell mod-name"><a href="#">{{this.author}}/{{this.name}}</a></span><span class="mod-cell mod-version">{{this.latest}}</span><span class="mod-cell mod-descr">{{this.description}}</span>
                </li>
            {{/each}}
            </ul>
        {{/each}}
