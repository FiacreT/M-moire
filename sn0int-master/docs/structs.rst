Structs
=======

This section describes all supported structs in depth. Please refer to this
section if in doubt about the correct usage of fields to ensure
interoperability between modules.

Domains
-------

Represents a registerable domain as defined by the `public suffix list
<https://publicsuffix.org/>`_. If in doubt check `psl_domain_from_dns_name
<reference.html#psl-domain-from-dns-name>`_.

``value``
  The domain name, like ``example.co.uk``.

Subdomains
----------

A subdomain of a `domain <#domains>`_. The depth is arbitrary, so
``foo.example.co.uk`` and ``foo.bar.example.co.uk`` are both valid subdomains
of ``example.co.uk``.

``value``
  The subdomain, like ``foo.bar.example.co.uk``.
``domain_id``
  The numeric id of a domain struct.
``resolvable``
  Whether the subdomain can be resolved to a A/AAAA record. nil if unknown.

-------

An ip address. Note that most of these fields are geoip related and an
approximation instead of an actual location.

    address.
``last_seen``
    The last time we've observed the device somewhere.

Networks
--------

A wired or wireless network at a specific location that a device could be
connected to.

``value``
    The network name. This can be an ssid or any other identifier but should be
    unique.

    domain for this as defined in `Domains`_.
``username``
    The users unique identifier, like the login name. If the login name is not
    known or the system doesn't use login names, use the email address instead.
``displayname``
    The users display name. This name is often not unique and may contain the
    users real name.
``email``
    The email address associated with the account.
``url``

Images
------

``value``
    The id that identifies the blob. This id is deterministic based on file

    and is commonly calculated with ``img_nudity``. A score above 1 means
    nudity has been detected.
``ahash``

``dhash``
    The Gradient (dHash) perceptual hash.
``phash``
    The DCT (pHash) perceptual hash.

Ports

    The port number.
``status``
    The status of the port, either ``open`` or ``closed``.
``banner``
    The service banner we discovered on this port.
``service``
    The service that is running on this port.
``version``
    The version of the service running on this port.

Netblocks
---------

A netblock is a network address range that has been allocated to an individual,
organization or company. Those are commonly found when running whois lookups on
an ip address.

Consider the following example: Running a whois lookup on ``140.82.118.4`` (one
of the addresses currently in use by github) returns that this address belongs
to the netrange ``140.82.112.0 - 140.82.127.255``, so the netblock in this case
is ``140.82.112.0/20``.

``family``
    This is either ``4`` or ``6`` and populated automatically.
``value``
    This is the network range in CIDR notation.
``asn``
    The number of the autonomous system this network belongs to.
``as_org``
    The organization of the autonomous system this network belongs to.
``description``
    This field isn't strictly defined and meant to be used as a human
    meaningful name if available.

Relations
---------

Relations are linking two structs together. The link may contain additional information.

subdomain_ipaddr
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Links an ip address to a subdomain.

``subdomain_id``
    The numeric id of a subdomain struct.
``ip_addr_id``
    The numeric id of an ip addr struct.

network_device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Links a device to a network. This is commonly used with ``db_add_ttl`` so the
link automatically expires. This is frequently used to monitor networks for
known and unknown devices.

``network_id``
    The numeric id of a network struct.
``device_id``
    The numeric id of a device struct.
``ipaddr``
    The ip address assigned to the device.
``last_seen``
    The last time we've seen the device on that network.

breach_email
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Links an email to a breach. If we know the password as well we can add it to
the link. If we don't know the password we can leave it blank and fill it
later. An email can be linked to a breach multiple times with different
passwords. There is a special upserting logic in place to support this.

``breach_id``
    The numeric id of a breach struct.
``email_id``
    The numeric id of an email struct.
``password``
    The password for that email in the breach.
